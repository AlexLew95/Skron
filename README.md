# Skron

Skript addon to link github and skript!

All files and dir in this repo will be a backup of my work during it. I don't recommand to compile and use it for the moment because a lot of feature are missing and/or don't work correctly.

Skrons uses [github-api](http://github-api.kohsuke.org/) to work.
